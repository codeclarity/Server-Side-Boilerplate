* Customizable <head> Template for HTML Documents

to the 'HTML Essentials Skeleton' to include a Performance and Speed induced .htaccess, robots.txt and more.

# Mission
Our mission is to provide a more than quick and easy way to implement a SEO Compliant Header that includes basic and advanced Meta-data, the DublinCore,
Geolocation and more. As of right now, this is a very preliminary repository.
