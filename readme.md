# Server-side Boilerplate (for HTML5 Boilerplate)

A complete server-side starting point for your HTML and Web Projects. Currently aimed at the Apache Server and uses techniques in the header of each HTML file,
also including a complete htaccess file and robots.txt.

* Customizable <head> Template for HTML Documents
* Includes Basic Meta-Data
* Includes DublinCore
* Includes Geo-location
* Incudes Robots.txt
* Includes .htaccess (Features include standard setup with redirection options, automatic UTF-8, gzip compress, etag revisions, cache-control by object, mobile detection and more).
* TODO- Separate HTML Files by Doctype and section off each portion of <head>, include more valuable Header inserts, possibly change the project over
to the 'HTML Essentials Skeleton' to include a Performance and Speed induced .htaccess, robots.txt and more.
* Suggestions welcome. <support@icodeclarity.com>

# Mission
Our mission is to provide a more than quick and easy way to implement a SEO Compliant Header that includes basic and advanced Meta-data, the DublinCore,
Geolocation and more. We would like to be considered a 'sub-module' for the HTML5 Boilerplate but have yet to discuss this with Paul Irish and that Team,
as we would like to iron out all of the dirty little details we can. As of right now, this is a very preliminary repository.

# Team
